This is a project to deploy a jenkins container with various tools to use for CI/CD workflows.

This is not ready for production but is intended for educational purposes.

# Project Objectives:
[CURRENT]
- Create an easier workflow to build a local Jenkins image based off the *latest* Jenkins public image.

- Deploy an initial container from this image and install all desired plugins and applications.

- Create a new image from this initial container and set that as the *new* baseline image that can be stored on a local or remote repository.

- Deploy containers from the resulting local Jenkins image to be used for various projects "as required".

# Prerequisites
Docker Engine or Docker Desktop installed on the system you intend to run this project.
